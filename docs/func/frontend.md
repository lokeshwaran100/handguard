# Handguard Index Project Summary, Frontend Screens, and Supabase Database Schema

## Project Summary
Handguard Index is a decentralized platform on Hedera that allows anyone to create and invest in cryptocurrency index funds. Each fund consists of a basket of tokens with equal weightings (for MVP), and issues a unique fund token representing ownership. The fund token’s value reflects the live combined value of its underlying assets, updated via a price oracle. Investors can buy and sell fund tokens, paying a small fee that rewards creators, funds buyback and burn of the governance token (HGI), and supports platform development. This platform brings transparency, accountability, and ease-of-use to crypto investing, enabling creators to earn rewards for performance and investors to gain diversified exposure without complex research.

## Frontend Guidelines

⚠️ **Do not use Shadcn or Radix UI.** Stick to lightweight, maintainable libraries and custom components.

- **UI Library Choices**:
  - TailwindCSS → primary styling
  - Headless UI (optional, for accessible modals/dropdowns)
  - React Hook Form for form handling
  - Chart.js or Recharts for basic portfolio/fund performance charts

- **Custom Components**:
  - `Button` (primary/secondary)
  - `Card` (fund display, form wrapper)
  - `Modal` (transaction confirmation, alerts)
  - `Input`, `Select`, `Slider` (for token weights)
  - `Navbar`, `Footer`

## Theme 

- **Primary Colors**:  
  - Blue (`#1E40AF` or similar deep blue) → for trust, professionalism, and highlights.  
  - White (`#FFFFFF`) → for clean backgrounds and readability.  
- **Secondary Colors**:  
  - Light Gray (`#F3F4F6`) for neutral sections and dividers.  
  - Green (`#10B981`) for success states (e.g., successful transactions).  
  - Red (`#EF4444`) for errors and warnings.
